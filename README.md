# IraoPack -- my Minecraft datapacks

This repo has my Minecraft datapacks that I use on my private server. Check this
[repo](https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/multiprovider-lazymc) if you're
interested in hosting your own server.

## IraoPortals

This [datapack](./IraoPortals) allows you to use paintings as portals. You can
link two paintings and teleport between them by jumping through them.

## Pokebalde

This [datapack](./Pokebalde) adds a new _bucket-like_ item that allows you to
put passive mobs into eggs. This creates a full copy of mob, including: health,
name, and owner.

## Acknowledgements

I use [minity](https://github.com/minity-script/minity) to build this datapacks,
which makes it much easier.
